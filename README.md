# R2Modman modlist comparison tool

This is a small script that compares two modlists from R2Modman for risk of rain although with some small tweaking it works for any of the games that R2Modman supports (changing one file path). <br />
It was made over the course of 2 hours and will only recieve bug fixes if it refuses to function. <br />
<br />
You use it by downloading the repository and running the file "Main.py", it will search your AppData Folder for the specified profile and either return: <br />
<br />
- An Error if the Profile doesnt exist or doesnt have the correct type of mods file in it <br />
- A Message containing all the missing and/or extra mods <br />
- A Message stating the two lists match <br />
